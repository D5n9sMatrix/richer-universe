Conversely, to prove iii) =⇒ i) write p = p 1 p 2 , where every root of p 1 is
imaginary and none of the roots of p 2 are imaginary. Now, let z be a root of p 2 .
Then, −z, z, and −z are also roots of p 2 with the same multiplicity as z. Hence,
there exists a polynomial p 20 ∈ R[s] such that p 2 (s) = p 20 (s)p 20 (−s) for all s ∈ C.
