Next, assuming that p has at least one imaginary root, write p 1 (s) =

mult p (jω i ). Let ω i 0 de-
i=1 s + ω i
note the smallest element of the set {ω 1 , . . . , ω k } such that m i is odd. Then, m i
4 k it follows that p 1 (jω) = i=1 ω i 2 − ω 2< 0 for all ω ∈ (ω i 0 , ω i 0 +1 ), where
ω k+1 = ∞. However, note that p 1 (jω) = p(jω)/p 2 (jω) = p(jω)/|p 20 (jω)| 2 ≥ 0 for
all ω ∈ R, which is a contradiction. Therefore, m i is even for all i = 1, . . . , k,
m i /2  4 k and thus p 1 (s) = p 10 (s)p 10 (−s) for all s ∈ C, where p 10 (s) = i=1 s 2 + ω i 2
Consequently, p(s) = p 10 (s)p 20 (s)p 10 (−s)p 20 (−s) for all s ∈ C. Finally, if p has no
imaginary roots, then p 1 = 1, and p(s) = p 20 (s)p 20 (−s) for all s ∈ C.
